-- Ex 5: below you'll find two datatypes, Egg and Milk. Implement a
-- type class Price, containing a function price. The price function
-- should return the price of an item.
--
-- The prices should be as follows:
-- * chicken eggs cost 20
-- * chocolate eggs cost 30
-- * milk costs 15 per liter
--
-- Example:
--   price ChickenEgg  ==>  20

data Egg = ChickenEgg | ChocolateEgg
  deriving Show

newtype Milk = Milk Int -- amount in litres
  deriving Show

class Price a where
  price :: a -> Int

instance Price Egg where
  price ChickenEgg = 20
  price ChocolateEgg = 30

instance Price Milk where  
  price (Milk a) = a * 15   


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Ex 6: define the necessary instance hierarchy in order to be able
-- to compute these:
--
-- price (Just ChickenEgg) ==> 20
-- price [Milk 1, Milk 2]  ==> 45
-- price [Just ChocolateEgg, Nothing, Just ChickenEgg]  ==> 50
-- price [Nothing, Nothing, Just (Milk 1), Just (Milk 2)]  ==> 45

instance (Price a) => Price  [a]  where
  price xs = foldl (\accu x -> accu + price x) 0 xs

instance (Price a) => Price (Maybe a) where
    price (Just x) = price x
    price Nothing = 0
